## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### Continued development

This is my first Frontend Mentor intermediate level challenge and the change of pace was quite evident. I had to deal with a lot more components hence a lot more css and heavier DOM manipulation. I also got to make a carousel for the first time. I still have a lot to learn but I feel like I'm making good progress. I'll be taking on more projects to keep improving and sharpening my skills.
